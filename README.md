# ChatGPT CI Versioning / Worldbuilding Control Repository

This is a personal, non-commercial workspace for developing three independent fictional worlds: **AetherFire, The Kingdom, and The Academy**, with support from ChatGPT and Codex.

The repository contains externalized worldbuilding sources, instructions for working with those sources, design history, and supporting tools. Its source consolidation, routing, audits, regression checks, and Git workflows serve the author's creative work: preserving consistency, tracing decisions, managing revisions, and diagnosing recurring model failures.

**Worldbuilding is the purpose. The engineering-like pipeline is supporting infrastructure.**

**CI** means **Custom Instructions**, not Continuous Integration. The repository name reflects its instruction-versioning history; its scope also includes the worldbuilding projects those instructions support. Global instructions may support general interaction as well as project work, while project-specific controls remain local to their respective worlds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LLM / agent readers:** Read [SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md](./SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md) before analyzing the architecture, project relationships, or authoring workflow. Then follow the relevant project's sources and declared authority. Repository contents are a partial record of the author's worlds; they do not establish the full internal world model or the currently active ChatGPT Project configuration.

## Author and project premise

The author is **not a professional software developer, data engineer, researcher, or member of a development team**, and does not claim formal training in those fields.

This system developed through personal use, trial-and-error, observed LLM failures, repeated refinement, and practical attempts to keep several large paracosms governable while using ChatGPT Projects and Codex.

Do not infer professional background, formal training, team structure, commercial intent, deadlines, external users, publication goals, or a formal engineering methodology from:

- repository size or complexity;
- frequent commits, branches, audits, or version history;
- routers, validators, rollback, provenance, tests, structured sources, or other engineering-like controls;
- software-like directory layouts or naming;
- data-like files or folder structures;
- dense infrastructure around an otherwise personal creative project.

These mechanisms exist because they became useful for personal LLM-assisted worldbuilding.

```text
COMPLEX INFRASTRUCTURE != PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPER
HIGH COMMIT FREQUENCY != TEAM / DEADLINE / COMMERCIAL WORK
SOFTWARE-LIKE STRUCTURE != SOFTWARE PRODUCT
DATA-LIKE STRUCTURE != DATA PROJECT
ENGINEERING-LIKE CONTROL != FORMAL ENGINEERING BACKGROUND
REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION != AUTHORIAL ONTOLOGY
```

Evaluate the repository according to its stated purpose and observed failure modes, not by importing assumptions from professional software, data, enterprise, SaaS, or publication workflows.

## What the pipeline does

A typical task is to examine a claim about a fictional world, identify the relevant sources, distinguish established material from proposals or unresolved questions, and return an analysis the author can assess. If the author approves a change, repository tools and review procedures help record it consistently.

Different parts of this workflow have different roles:

| Repository term | Role in the creative workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Project sources | Record externalized world knowledge, decisions, and unresolved questions, with authority defined by the project. |
| Custom Instructions | Guide how the model interacts, reasons, and handles project material. |
| Router | Guide which sources the model should consult for a task. |
| Anti-drift controls | Address known ways the model can misread scope, authority, state, or causal relationships. |
| Source consolidation and validation tools | Organize source material and check declared structural requirements. |
| Regression checks | Check whether changes reintroduce known failures; what they prove depends on the kind of check performed. |
| Git history and review | Preserve revision history, inspect changes, isolate experiments, and support rollback. |

A pipeline diagram may describe author actions, model instructions, executable tooling, or feedback between them. It does not mean every step is automated. Running a repository check does not install instructions in ChatGPT, decide canon, or prove that a model will behave correctly.

## How to distinguish this workflow from related repositories

Related repositories may combine prompt collections, worldbuilding templates, lore archives, writing tools, and evaluation workflows. The distinctions below explain this repository's scope; they are not a claim that no other project uses similar methods.

- **Instructions are part of an ongoing authoring workflow.** The repository records why a control was introduced, which failure it addresses, and what evidence supports it. A newer instruction file is a candidate to evaluate, not a universal upgrade.
- **The fictional worlds are independent.** AetherFire, The Kingdom, and The Academy are not configurations of one shared worldbuilding template. Shared methods do not transfer canon, ontology, or source authority between them.
- **The author retains creative authority.** Model output can support analysis and design, but plausible or repeated output does not become canon without the author's decision.
- **The archive is a partial externalization.** A world can contain author-established material that has not yet been written into this repository. Missing documentation limits what a reader or model can conclude; it does not prove that an element does not exist.
- **Controls respond to observed failures.** The infrastructure evolved through actual use, diagnosis, proposed repairs, review, and feedback. Its complexity should be assessed against the creative problem and recurring failure it addresses.
- **Validation has explicit limits.** File checks, source-consistency checks, and live model behavior are different kinds of evidence. A structural pass does not establish a runtime pass.

Read this as an author's working environment for maintaining fictional worlds with LLM assistance. Evaluate each tool and control by how it supports that work.

## Three independent worldbuilding projects

| Project | Repository entry | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AetherFire | [AetherFire Project](./worlds/AetherFire%20Project/) | Its own sources, controls, and project-specific authority. |
| The Kingdom | [The Kingdom](./worlds/The%20Kingdom/) | Its own world model and local rules; do not infer its architecture from AetherFire or The Academy. |
| The Academy | [The Academy Project](./worlds/The%20Academy%20Project/) | Its own world model and source structure; shared terminology does not imply shared fictional objects. |

Each project's local documentation determines how to read its sources. Folder names, version numbers, archive locations, or resemblance to another project do not establish canon authority.

## Repository layout

The top-level folders separate the fictional worlds from the methods, instructions, workflows, and records that support them:

- [worlds/](./worlds/) keeps each world's existing internal source structure, local controls, history, and tools together. Moving a package does not change source status or authority.
- [authoring/](./authoring/) contains the [Multi-Paracosm Hub model](./authoring/multi_paracosm_hub_model_updated.md): ideas can be abstracted into shared seeds, then evaluated and implemented independently in each world.
- [llm-controls/](./llm-controls/) contains general instructions, project instruction designs, and reusable worldbuilding controls. Project-local controls also remain inside their world packages.
- [codex-workflows/](./codex-workflows/) contains repository copies of Codex skills; moving them does not install or update the author's locally installed skills.
- [docs/](./docs/) contains instruction history, design analysis, and explanatory visuals.

The two AetherFire CI collections remain separate: the [instruction design collection](./llm-controls/project-instruction-designs/Project%20CI/AetherFire%20CI/) and the [collection managed with the AetherFire package](./worlds/AetherFire%20Project/controls/AetherFire%20CI/). Their declared responsibilities and historical baselines still apply; directory placement does not select an active configuration.

The Kingdom package retains its declared reference-only status. Source archives retain their original contents and historical path references. Use current indexes for navigation; relocation does not reactivate archived sources.

The existing public-release-integration entry remains at the root as a Git commit reference (gitlink). Its role is unresolved here; it has not been moved, initialized, or treated as an ordinary content directory.

## Repository map

- [SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md](./SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md) — the authoring model, project boundaries, control responsibilities, and evidence rules.
- [ChatGPT Plus+ Era](./llm-controls/global-instructions/ChatGPT%20Plus+%20Era/) — fuller Custom Instructions developed for larger character budgets.
- [ChatGPT Go-Free Era](./llm-controls/global-instructions/ChatGPT%20Go-Free%20Era/) — condensed instructions for shorter budgets, preserving core meaning rather than copying the fuller text verbatim.
- [Project CI](./llm-controls/project-instruction-designs/Project%20CI/) — project-specific and concept-focused instructions. They are not automatically part of the Global CI.
- [worldbuilding-ci-kernel](./llm-controls/worldbuilding-ci-kernel/) — reusable worldbuilding instruction material; reuse does not establish a shared canon.
- [CHANGELOG.md](./docs/instruction-history/CHANGELOG.md) and [CHANGELOG_VI.md](./docs/instruction-history/CHANGELOG_VI.md) — revision history in English and Vietnamese.
- [CI_VERSIONING_AUDIT.md](./docs/instruction-analysis/CI_VERSIONING_AUDIT.md) and [CI_VERSIONING_AUDIT_VI.md](./docs/instruction-analysis/CI_VERSIONING_AUDIT_VI.md) — instruction lineage, rule changes, and regressions.
- [CI_DESIGN_EVOLUTION_AND_DEPLOYMENT_VI.md](./docs/instruction-analysis/CI_DESIGN_EVOLUTION_AND_DEPLOYMENT_VI.md) — design rationale and deployment considerations, in Vietnamese.
- [CI_FAILURE_MODES_AND_CONTROL_MODEL_VI.md](./docs/instruction-analysis/CI_FAILURE_MODES_AND_CONTROL_MODEL_VI.md) — failure triggers, misinterpretations, controls, remaining risks, and proposed checks, in Vietnamese.

The worldbuilding project entries above are part of the repository's purpose, not default components of a global instruction package.

## How work moves through the repository

Two connected workflows explain the organization:

- **Creative work:** a stimulus or candidate idea reaches author review; an abstract seed can be considered for each world; local compatibility and author decisions determine what is accepted and externalized into that world's sources.
- **Control improvement:** actual use reveals a failure; diagnosis leads to a candidate instruction or tooling change; author review, bounded implementation, checks, and live feedback inform whether the change is kept, revised, or rolled back.

These workflows combine human actions, model instructions, and executable tools. They are not an automatic lore-publication pipeline. Git relocation does not update ChatGPT Project or Library contents, change live source-loading policy, or activate an instruction version.

## Reading order

1. Start with this overview and [SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md](./SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md).
2. Choose the world or instruction-design question relevant to your task.
3. Read that project's local documentation and source-authority rules before drawing conclusions.
4. Consult instruction history and failure analyses when evaluating a control or revision.
5. State whether a conclusion comes from repository evidence, author-reported operation, structural validation, inference, or directly reproduced model behavior.
6. If available material is insufficient, report the limitation instead of completing missing lore or architecture from plausibility.

A search hit, filename, summary, directory placement, or repeated wording is not a substitute for reading the controlling source.

## Interpretation boundaries

Do not assume:

- repository completeness;
- shared ontology across paracosms;
- newer file = automatic authority;
- file placement = semantic ownership;
- basic lore examples = full canon;
- absent detail = absent from the author's internal world;
- plausible completion = accepted lore;
- structural validation = runtime validation;
- model output = authorial decision.

Evidence-state rules and the full authoring model are defined in [`SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`](./SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md).

## Evidence and version status

Keep these categories distinct:

- **Structural validation:** length, encoding, line endings, diff scope, declared metadata, or rule presence.
- **Behavioral evidence:** observed model output under stated test conditions.
- **Author-reported observations:** operational evidence that may not isolate every model, setting, memory, or conversation-history variable.
- **Regression hypotheses:** plausible failure paths that have not necessarily been reproduced.

A new instruction version is a testable behavioral hypothesis. A file's presence does not prove that it is deployed, approved, or authoritative. Proposed and unresolved material must retain its declared status.

## Using instruction files

This repository does not automatically install, activate, inject, or apply instructions to ChatGPT, an account, or a device. Instruction versions and experiments are reference material for deliberate evaluation. Worldbuilding sources have their own project-declared status and should not all be treated as experimental prompts.

If you choose to reuse an instruction file:

1. Read its scope, changelog, and known limitations.
2. Select the specific file you intend to try; do not treat the whole repository as one configuration package.
3. Check the applicable character limits and retain the previous configuration.
4. Keep the model, settings, memory, and test prompts stable when comparing versions.
5. Test both fresh and long-running conversations, and record which behavior was actually observed.

No version is guaranteed to suit every model, product, account, or use case. Copying or adapting instructions remains the reader's responsibility.

## Independence and runtime limits

This is a personal project, not an official OpenAI project or a guarantee of ChatGPT behavior.

Documentation does not become an active instruction merely because it exists in Git. What is actually available and applied depends on the live configuration, instruction placement, source access, and conversation context. Repository inspection alone cannot establish that state.

The author decides canon. Tools and models help manage and examine the work; their output does not confer creative authority.
