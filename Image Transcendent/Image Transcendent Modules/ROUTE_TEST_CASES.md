# Route and prompt-preservation cases

These are review cases, not evidence that a ChatGPT Project or image generator has passed. Keep the model, Project instructions, active Sources, and other conditions constant when running comparisons.

| Case | Input or state | Expected routing or prompt behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No template | Manifest says `OPTIONAL_ABSENT`; no active template supplied | Skip template and process current prompt. |
| Missing active template | Manifest says ACTIVE; template cannot be loaded | Stop and identify the missing template. |
| Conflicting inventory | Manifest says absent; active template appears | Stop for inconsistent release inventory. |
| Clear override | Template sets a blue coat; current prompt explicitly asks for a red coat | Use red coat; retain unrelated compatible template fields. |
| Ambiguous hard conflict | Template locks two arms; current prompt implies a different anatomy without clear override intent | Ask about anatomy before generation. |
| Negative without count | Current prompt says "not five fingers" | Keep that negative; do not infer exactly four fingers. |
| Nonhuman subject | Current prompt asks for a landscape | Do not apply body, clothing, beauty, or attraction criteria. |
| Local edit | Change only one object in an existing image | Preserve all other visible regions as far as the tool permits. |
| Hidden hard field | Required count is obscured in the output | Mark UNVERIFIABLE, not PASS. |

For each live case, record the original user prompt, active versions, tool-facing prompt when observable, result image, verified constraints, defects, and uncertainty. Do not interpret a static route check as a live model result.
